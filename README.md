# simple-neural-network-python

This is just a simple 3 layer neural network I made while playing around in python.
It is designed to recognize handwritten numbers from the MNIST datasets available online.

Included is a setup script that will automatically download, unarchive, convert, and remove the old files to setup the files needed to run the neural network.

Once the setup script is run, you can then modify the parameters of the testNetwork.py file to train and test the network while seeing how well it performs. With a little tweaking the network can be easily loaded into another program or even have it's link weights saved in a db or text file.

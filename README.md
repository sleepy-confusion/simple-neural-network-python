# simple-neural-network-python

This is just a program I made while learning about machine learning, it has only three layers in the first iteration. The datasets used for training and testing were acquired from the MNIST datasets as of 9/1/2016. A simple conversion script(UConverter.py) is included to make them easier to read and use.

The basic neural network only has three layers, an input layer, a hidden layer, and the output layer. Tweaking the number of nodes, epochs(training cycles), and learning rate have great effect on the network (unless you have a FAST computer I wouldn't recommend too many epochs, <10)
